    - title: Welcome to HelixLauncher

      description: >
        This is the official Discord server for the HelixLauncher project.
        
        
        HelixLauncher is an open-source Minecraft Launcher written from the ground-up in Rust.
        We have split HelixLauncher into two main parts, the backend library, which anyone can use for their own launchers
        and the GUI/CLI packages, which use the library to create a user-friendly Minecraft launcher.
        
        
        We hope you enjoy your time with us!
