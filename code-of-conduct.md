# Code of Conduct

- This document, like all Codes of Conduct, is a standard for good behavior.
- We (the staff of Helix Launcher) have drafted it to provide accountability -- to help users understand what behavior is and isn't welcome.
- **People who don't read this document will still be subjected to it. If you don't understand a relevant part of it, feel free to ask us or other community members for clarification.**
- We want this document to be clear, readable, and concise. [Right now it is none of those things ;w;]

## [Draft notes â€“ write your own when redrafting; remove them in the final draft]

- This draft will sound dry, aggressive and terse. Most of my serious writing does.
- I deal in absolutes when needed. (i'm not a sith cktvgbypnmi,o)
- I don't expect or want this draft to sound anything like the final one.
- Should we use a google doc or smth (preferably something owned by a company that respects its users instead)

## Rules

[These should be unambiguous and specific.]

## Guidelines

While you are here, we expect you to treat other users well, regardless of outside social expectations. Misunderstandings **will** happen and that's okay.

Here are some ways you can treat others well:

- Be kind and respectful.
- Report users who break the rules or guidelines.
- Take responsibility for your mistakes, and learn from them.
- If someone wants you to leave them alone, leave them alone.

### Bigotry
Here are some common forms of bigotry in online spaces. We detest them ^^
- Homophobia
- Transphobia
- Neuronormativity

### Drama
There are only a few reasons that one should be a trashbag. And they aren't that relevant to Minecraft.
- Insensitivity (i.e. a lot of people don't like excessive swearing or high-resolution pictures of bugs)
- Advocating piracy or other breaches of the law (well-warranted or not)
- 18+ behavior outside 18+ spaces
- Ad hominems/namecalling
- Political discussion
- Spam

### Enforcement

Moderators should strive to enforce the code. Other users still bear a basic level of responsibility.

Keep in mind that moderators are not your property. They will put accountability and people's needs first, even when you think that's unfair.

Moderators' severity will match the severity of offenses. Most users will be given warnings for their first offense.

## TL;DR

We want to avoid bigotry and drama, because ultimately this is a hobby project for a block game. If you don't like that, pack up your ideology and leave.
