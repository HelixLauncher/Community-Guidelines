# Code of Conduct

Helix Launcher bases it's policies around a Code of Conduct, it provides
behavoural expectations for all members interacting in our community. **Not
reading the Code of Conduct is not an excuse for breaking it**

## The Pledge

We as community members, contributors, and team members pledge to make our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, no matter one's age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, nationality, physical or mental disabilities, neurodivergencies, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status or subcultural affiliation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community, and we are committed to promoting these concepts.

## Standards

We expect community members to act in a positive, authentic, and deliberate way. Consideration and respect provides a basis for a solid community, and we request our members actions reflect these values. We also expect communities to refrain from talking about, or encouraging illegal activities, including, but not limited to, piracy, substance use, and theft.

Please take into account that online communities bring people together from many different cultures and backgrounds. Itâ€™s important to understand that sometimes the combination of cultural differences and online interaction can lead to misunderstandings.

Examples of positive behavours include, but are not limited to
- Demonstrating kindness and consideration towards others
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences, and opinions
- Respecting others' personal choices, even when they don't match your viewpoints
- Apologizing for, accepting responsibility for, and leaning from mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

## Enforcement 

Moderators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

If a community member engages in behavior violating this Code of Conduct, the members of the moderation team may take any action they deem appropriate. Actions may range from a simple warning to the most drastic: permanent removal from the community, exclusion from any interaction, and loss of all rights in the community.
