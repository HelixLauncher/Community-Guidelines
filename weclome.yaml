    Try to speak English: >
      The common language in our community is English, but we understand that not everyone speaks English at the same
      level. Try to speak English to the best of your ability, and don't worry if you need to use translation tools. We
      will not tolerate making fun of people for poor English.

    Listen to & respect all community team members: >
      Please take requests from community team members seriously and listen when a team member asks you to do
      something. If you have a problem with what a team member is asking you to do, we advise that you step away from
      the situation and send a private message to another team member.

    Keep all projects legal, legitimate & appropriate: >
      We will not tolerate any projects that may break laws, breach a Terms of Service or an EULA, involve sexual
      content, or that the moderators determine to be malicious or inappropriate.

    Donâ€™t spam: >
      Don't spam our channels or users, and don't advertise your projects outside of the relevant showcase channels.

    Respect our channels: >
      Follow the given channel topic, and don't derail a discussion

    Don't import drama or controversy from other communities: >
      One of our most important rules - don't make things difficult for other users by bringing up controversies from
      other communities.
